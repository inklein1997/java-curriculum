## Student Do: Train Reservation

In this activity, you will create a web service that supports train reservations. This web service will get its configuration from a cloud config server.

### Instructions

1. Create a MySQL database named `train_tracker` with the following tables:

   - `customer`

   - `train`

   - `station`

   - `ticket`

   - `route`

   - `route_station`

   **Hint:** Sample data for each table is provided later.

2. Create a new public GitHub repository in your account.

3. Create a new properties file called ```train-reservation.properties``` in the new repository that contains the configuration for the `train-reservation` service.

   - The service should run on port 7602.

   - The service needs connection information to the `train-tracker` database.

4. Create a new Spring Cloud Config Server project called `firstname-lastname-cloud-config-server` using the Spring Initializr. Have the server run on port 9999, and have it use the GitHub repository that you created.

5. Create a new Spring Boot REST web service called `firstname-lastname-train-reservation`. This web service must meet the following requirements:

   - Uses the Config Server created in the previous step for all of its configuration settings

   - Runs on port 7602

   - Uses Spring Data JPA to communicate with the `train-tracker` database

   - Contains the following endpoints for each entity:

      - `Create`

      - `GetById`

      - `Update`

      - `Delete`

      - `Get All`
