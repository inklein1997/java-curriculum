## Student Do: Unchecked Exceptions

**Starter & Solved Folders: [02-stu-unchecked-exceptions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17HVEoflEpoxl0A4jMGxp5dGaAUS3iI7O/view?usp=sharing)**

In this exercise, you will use try/catch to gracefully handle an application error.

**Instructions:**

1. Run the provided starter code using a numeric input. The program should run successfully.
2. Run the provided starter code using a non-numeric input (like your name). The program should NOT run successfully.
3. Using the try/catch syntax that you saw in the first example, try to figure out how to catch this error and print "You must type in a number."


## Student Do: Testing Exceptions ArrayFun

**Solved Folder: [04-stu-testing-exceptions-arrayfun](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dlJ0l1-Hxx0lImJUqt6WtjKCrSVu2fzZ/view?usp=sharing)**

In this exercise, you will use TDD to gracefully handle an `IllegalArgumentException`.

**Instructions:**

Work in pairs to complete all of the following goals.

### Goals

- Create a new IntelliJ project called `TestingExceptionsArrayFun`.
- Create a new class called `com.company.ArrayFun`.
- Create a new test class called `com.company.ArrayFunTest`.
- In `ArrayFunTest`, write tests to test a method that takes an array of arrays and returns an array with the average of each inner array.
- The method should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if any of the numbers are negative.
- After you have failing tests, implement the method in `ArrayFun`.

**Input:** `[ [1,2,3] , [4, 4, 4], [2, 4, 6] ]` **Output:** `[2, 4, 4]`


## Student Do: Exception Exercise

**Starter & Solved Folders: [05-stu-exceptions-exercise](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13KpvNfEUqTIFiZwkm4Y993lpb30M_dgP/view?usp=sharing)**

In this exercise, you will use TDD to gracefully handle several application exceptions.

**Instructions:**

### Structure

- Add the code necessary to the `Application` class found in the `starter` project `ExceptionExercise`.
- Tests can be found in the `test/java` directory.

### Requirements

Handle the following exceptions:

1. When a user enters a non-integer value, display "Please enter a valid number."
2. When a user chooses a value not present in the array, display "Please choose an available pet."
3. If the file does not exist, display the message "The following file does not seem to exist:" along with the output from the Exception `.getMessage()`.
4. If there was trouble writing the file, display "Something went wrong while writing your file."
5. Regardless of success or exceptions, tell the user to "Have a nice day!"

**Note** The test will delete `pets.txt`, so you may need to recreate it in the root of your project directory. 


## We Do: Lambdas and Streams

**Starter & Solved Folders: [06-we-lambdas-streams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m2eqRoNhqfcMZOC4MJMg_dqzTqMg_Rhz/view?usp=sharing)**

In this exercise, you will examine code that uses lambdas and streams to handle motorcycle data.

Follow along with the instructor throughout the exercise.

**Instructions:**

### Step 1: Filter and ForEach Examples

* The filter example matches the previous example.
* The `forEach` operation takes a lambda expression that doesn't return anything. We must have the curly braces in this example because we have more than one statement.

```java
package com.company;

import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {

            List<Motorcycle> bikes = MotoFileIO.getMotorcycles("motorcycles.csv");

            // Print the information for all Suzuki motorcycles in inventory
            String make = "Suzuki";
            System.out.println("All " + make + " motorcycles in inventory: ");
            bikes
                    .stream()
                    .filter(b -> b.getMake().equals(make))
                    .forEach(bike -> {
                        System.out.println("===============");
                        System.out.println("Make: " + bike.getMake());
                        System.out.println("Model: " + bike.getModel());
                        System.out.println("Color: " + bike.getColor());
                        System.out.println("Year: " + bike.getYear());
                        System.out.println("Displacement: " + bike.getDisplacement());
                        System.out.println("Horsepower: " + bike.getHorsepower());
                        System.out.println("Weight: " + bike.getWeight());
                    });
```

### Step 2: Another Filter ForEach Example

- Here, we filter so we get only bikes that weigh less than 500 pounds.

```java
            // Print the information for all motorcycles that weigh less than 500 pounds
            int weight = 500;
            bikes
                    .stream()
                    .filter(bike -> bike.getWeight() < weight)
                    .forEach(bike -> {
                        System.out.println("===============");
                        System.out.println("Make: " + bike.getMake());
                        System.out.println("Model: " + bike.getModel());
                        System.out.println("Color: " + bike.getColor());
                        System.out.println("Year: " + bike.getYear());
                        System.out.println("Displacement: " + bike.getDisplacement());
                        System.out.println("Horsepower: " + bike.getHorsepower());
                        System.out.println("Weight: " + bike.getWeight());
                    });
```

### Step 3: Collection Example

- Here, we put the results in a collection rather than just print the results to the screen.

```java
            // Rather than printing out the matching motorcycles, let's put them into a list
            List<Motorcycle> lightBikes =
            bikes
                    .stream()
                    .filter(bike -> bike.getWeight() < weight)
                    .collect(Collectors.toList());

            System.out.println(lightBikes.size());
```

### Step 4: Group By Example

- Here, we group all of the bikes by manufacturer. This results in a `Map<String, List<Motorcycle>>` where the key is the name of the manufacturer.

```java
            // We can also group our motorcycles by Make.
            Map<String, List<Motorcycle>> groupedBikes =
            bikes
                    .stream()
                    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(b -> b.getMake()));

            Set<String> keys = groupedBikes.keySet();
            for(String key : keys) {
                System.out.println(key);
            }
```

### Step 5: Average Example

- Here we transform the stream of motorcycles into a stream of integers (which are the horsepower values for each bike) and then we calculate the average horsepower.
- Note the use of `getAsDouble()`.

```java
            // Print the average horsepower of the motorcycles in inventory
            double avgHorsepower =
            bikes
                    .stream()
                    .mapToInt(b -> b.getHorsepower())
                    .average()
                    .getAsDouble();

            System.out.println("Average horsepower is: " + avgHorsepower);
```

### Step 6: Find Maximum Example

- Here, we find the maximum horsepower value.

```java
            int maxHorsePower =
            bikes
                    .stream()
                    .mapToInt(bike -> bike.getHorsepower())
                    .max()
                    .getAsInt();

            System.out.println("Max horsepower: " + maxHorsePower);



        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Could not find CSV file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

}
```


## Student Do: Lambda Stream Exercise

**Starter & Solved Folders: [07-stu-lambdas-streams-exercise](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vYNqRydx2-5UKgwdhaNWhoYHfyhv1wMg/view?usp=sharing)**

In this exercise, you will make use of lambdas and streams to handle television data.

**Instructions:**

### Structure

- Create a new project called `LambdasStreamsExercise`.
- Use the CSV data and helper class found in the `starter` directory.
- No tests are provided for this lesson.

### Requirements

Using the data provided in `televisions.csv`, complete the following. Use lambdas and streams for all of these where appropriate.

1. Using the provided `FileIO` helper class, read the data from the `.csv` and store it as a `List`.
  - **Note**: The `FileIO` class requires that `Television` has a no-args (default) constructor.
2. Find all televisions with a screen size greater than 60 inches. Use the `.forEach` method to print out all entries.
3. Group all televisions into a `Map` by `brand`. Print out the list of brands.
4. Find and display the average `screenSize`.
5. Find and display the largest screen.

### Challenge

1. Sort the data by screen size, and then print out the sorted list.
