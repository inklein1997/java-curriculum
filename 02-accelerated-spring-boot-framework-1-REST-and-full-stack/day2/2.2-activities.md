## We Do: MockMVC Record Store

**Starter & Solved Folders:** [01-we-mockmvc-record-store](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r3ro4TRm40jRri-km3RZ41O9iL4zWLNZ/view?usp=sharing)

In this exercise, you will use MockMVC to test a record store API.

Follow along with the instructor throughout the exercise.

### Open Starter Project

* The JUnit 4.13 dependency has already been added to the `pom.xml` file.

* The project includes:

  * Empty `RecordstoreController` class

  * Complete `Record` model class

### Create the RecordStoreControllerTest Class

* Put your cursor on the `RecordStoreController` class name.

* Open the Navigate menu at the top of IntelliJ.

* Choose Test in that menu.

* Click Create New Test.

* Make sure JUnit 4 is selected in the Testing Library drop-down menu.

### Add Code to the Test Class

Add the following code to the new test class, including the `@RunWith` and `@WebMvcTest` annotations at the top of the class:

```java
// imports excluded for brevity

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@WebMvcTest(RecordStoreController.class)
public class RecordStoreControllerTests {

    // Wiring in the MockMvc object
    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    // ObjectMapper used to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa
    private ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        // This is the standard setup method that runs before each test. It's typically used for instantiating test
        // objects. We don't have to do anything special for mockMvc because it's autowired. We will, however, be using
        // setUp() in the future.
    }
}
```

### MockMVC Testing Strategy

The purpose of this section is to develop a strategy or set of guidelines for using MockMvc to test controllers.

* Look at the functionality of each endpoint and test for the following:

  * Happy path&mdash;test that both the correct content and the correct HTTP status code are returned when valid input is entered.

  * Error conditions&mdash;test that the correct HTTP status codes and error content are returned when invalid input is entered.

    ```java
    // testing GET /records
    @Test
    public void shouldReturnAllRecordsInCollection() throws Exception {

        // ARRANGE and ACT
        mockMvc.perform(get("/records"))       // Perform the GET request.
                .andDo(print())                          // Print results to console.
                .andExpect(status().isOk())              // ASSERT (status code is 200)

                // ASSERT that the JSON array is present and not empty. We will test GET all endpoints deeper in the
                // future, but this is good enough for now.
                .andExpect(jsonPath("$[0]").isNotEmpty());
    }
    
    // testing POST /records
    @Test
    public void shouldReturnNewRecordOnPostRequest() throws Exception {

        // ARRANGE
        Record inputRecord = new Record();
        inputRecord.setArtist("Bruce Springsteen");
        inputRecord.setAlbum("The River");

        // Convert Java Object to JSON.
        String inputJson = mapper.writeValueAsString(inputRecord);

        Record outputRecord = new Record();
        outputRecord.setArtist("Bruce Springsteen");
        outputRecord.setAlbum("The River");
        outputRecord.setId(6);

        String outputJson = mapper.writeValueAsString(outputRecord);

        // ACT
        mockMvc.perform(
                post("/records")                            // Perform the POST request.
                        .content(inputJson)                           // Set the request body.
                        .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)      // Tell the server it's in JSON format.
        )
                .andDo(print())                                // Print results to the console.
                .andExpect(status().isCreated())               // ASSERT (status code is 201)
                .andExpect(content().json(outputJson));        // ASSERT that what we're expecting is what we got back.
    }
    ```

The code for the MockMvc activity can be found in the starter folder.

Add tests for the `GET` route at `/records/{id}`.

Once you have completed that route, test your `PUT` and `DELETE` routes, too. Ponder the question of what to test if a method is expected to return nothing.

You can run all these tests and should expect all tests to fail because the `RecordStoreController` functionality has not yet been implemented. Failures occur because 404 HTTP responses are returned to the test. As you move forward, we will implement the `RecordStoreController` functionality and confirm each of these tests at that time.

### Instructor Review: MockMvc Testing Strategy

Review the solution. Pay attention to how we can check for status code on methods that return void. The solution code can be found in the solved folder.

```java
    // testing GET record/{id}
    @Test
    public void shouldReturnRecordById() throws Exception {

        // ARRANGE
        Record outputRecord = new Record();
        outputRecord.setArtist("Billy Joel");
        outputRecord.setAlbum("The Stranger");
        outputRecord.setId(2);

        String outputJson = mapper.writeValueAsString(outputRecord);

        // ACT
        mockMvc.perform(get("/records/2"))
                .andDo(print())
                .andExpect(status().isOk())                     // ASSERT that we got back 200 OK.
                .andExpect(content().json(outputJson));         // ASSERT that what we're expecting is what we got back.
    }

    // testing PUT /records/{id}
    @Test
    public void shouldUpdateByIdAndReturn204StatusCode() throws Exception {

        // ARRANGE
        Record inputRecord = new Record();
        inputRecord.setArtist("William Joel");
        inputRecord.setAlbum("The Stranger");
        inputRecord.setId(2);

        String inputJson = mapper.writeValueAsString(inputRecord);

        // ACT
        mockMvc.perform(
                put("/records/2")
                        .content(inputJson)
                        .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        )
                .andDo(print())
                .andExpect(status().isNoContent()); // ASSERT that we got back 204 NO CONTENT.

        // ACT
        mockMvc.perform(
                get("/records/2")
                        .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        )
                .andDo(print())
                .andExpect(content().json(inputJson)); // ASSERT that the record was updated successfully.
    }

    // testing DELETE /records/{id}
    @Test
    public void shouldDeleteByIdAndReturn204StatusCode() throws Exception {

        // This method returns nothing, so we're just checking for the correct status code,
        // in this case, code 204, which indicates No Content. We will test deletes deeper in the future.
        mockMvc.perform(delete("/records/5"))
                .andDo(print())
                .andExpect(status().isNoContent());
    }
```

## We Do: Echo Service

**Solved Folder:** [02-we-echo-service](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CPKFUvO2lvhDvJ7IPbPSE70g3l6mzYfh/view?usp=sharing)

The purpose of this code-along is to learn how to create a simple REST API using Spring Initializr and the routing and response annotations presented in the previous section. This example shows how to map path variables to method parameters.

Follow along with the instructor throughout the exercise.

### Create and Configure the Project

1. Open your browser and navigate to start.spring.io.

2. Create a new project with the following settings (anything not specified in the following should be left at the default value):

   * Project Metadata&mdash;Artifact: echo-service

   * Dependencies: Web

3. Click Generate Project.

4. Unzip the project and open it in IntelliJ.

5. Open the `pom.xml` file.

6. Add the following dependency in the section of the `pom.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>junit</groupId>
       <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
       <version>4.13</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
   </dependency>  
   ```

### Create the Controller

1. Create a new class called `com.company.controller.EchoServiceController`.

2. Open your `EchoServiceController` and implement the following:

    ```java
    package com.example.echoservice.controller;

    import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

    @RestController
    public class EchoServiceController {

        @RequestMapping(value = "/echo/{input}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
        @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.OK)
        public String echo(@PathVariable String input) {
            return input;
        }
    ```

### Review the Code

Note the following:

* `@RestController`

* `@RequestMapping`

  * Sets the REST "noun" and "verb."

* `@ResponseStatus`

  * You can specify what HTTP response code we want to return. In this case, it is 200 OK.

* `@PathVariable`

### Compile, Run, and Hit the Endpoint

Compile and run your services. Visit the endpoint with both a browser and Postman.

## We Do: Record Store

**Starter & Solved Folders:** [03-we-record-store](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y9aAb4K8wwAoLzELb0iLHwIwpFBjZT7L/view?usp=sharing)

The purpose of this code-along is to lean how to create a simple REST web service and the routing and response annotations presented in the previous section. This example shows how to map request body JSON to method parameters. You will code only one of the endpoints for this service.

### Open and Examine the Project

1. Open the starter code Record Store project in IntelliJ. Use the starter code rather than the code you created in the previous section.

2. Examine the tests for the Record Store service.
   * These are the tests you previously wrote for this service using MockMvc.

To implement a RESTful API, you need to have an object to which to map your data. This is called the **data transfer object**, or **DTO**.

* Open the `Record` class in the `models` package.

* This is our DTO for your application.

Explain that now you want to implement the routes so that your API behaves as expected.

1. Open the `RecordStoreController` class.

2. Included is some dummy data for this API to work with:

   * In a real application, you'd use a backing database, but for now, you're using in-memory storage in the form of a lList.

3. Now you're ready to add some routes.

### Record the POST Endpoint

With your DTO and tests already created, you are ready to move forward and create our **controller**.

* Open your `RecordStoreController` and implement the following:

   * Note that you're leaving out the `@Valid` annotation in this version (it appears in the solution code). You'll add validation in a later step.

```java
// Imports excluded for brevity.

@RestController
public class RecordStoreController {

    private List<Record> recordList;

    private static int idCounter = 1;

    private static List<Record> recordList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(
            new Record("The Beach Boys", "Pet Sounds", idCounter++),
            new Record("Billy Joel", "The Stranger", idCounter++),
            new Record("The Beatles", "Revolver", idCounter++),
            new Record("Kanye West", "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy", idCounter++),
            new Record("Sturgill Simpson", "Metamodern Sounds in Country Music", idCounter++)
    ));

    @RequestMapping(value = "/records", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.CREATED)
    public Record createRecord(@RequestBody Record record) {

        record.setId(idCounter++);
        recordList.add(record);

        return record;
    }
}
```

### Review Code

Note the following:

* `@RestController`

* `@RequestMapping`

  * Note that to change our method, we simply changed the value for `method` in the annotation.

* `@ResponseStatus`

  * You can specify what HTTP response code you want to return. In this case, it is 201 Created.

* `@RequestBody`

  * This annotation tells the Spring Framework and the Jackson Mapper component to convert the JSON in the request body to a Java object and pass it into the method.

* The return value from the method gets returned to the client. The `Record` object will get converted from Java to JSON by the Jackson Mapper.

### Compile, Run, and Hit the Endpoint

Compile and run your service. Hit the endpoint with both a browser and Postman.

### Students Complete Record Service

Using the previous code as a guide, complete the following:

1. Implement the remaining endpoints for our Record Store service.

2. Once you have the endpoints written, test them using the MockMvc tests you previously wrote.

## Student Do: Web Service Build

**Solved Folder:** [04-stu-web-service-build](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19gvCjeC3wdhI77gUYK1sUtM_4vwXU50n/view?usp=sharing)

### Spring Boot and REST Web Service Build

#### Structure

Your solution must have the following structural elements:

* Your solution must be in an IntelliJ project called `WebServiceBuild`.

* Your project must be built using Spring Boot and Spring MVC. Initialize your project using start.spring.io.

* Your project must have a series of tests using MockMvc.

* Your project must store quote, word, and Magic 8 ball data in a list as shown in the Record Store service in this module.

* Your REST API must be documented with Swagger. Save the `.yaml` file in the root of your project directory.

#### Requirements/Features

This web service is a quote-of-the-day, word-of-the-day, and Magic 8 ball service. You must implement and document the following REST APIs:

* Quote API:

  * URI: `/quote`

  * Method: `GET`

  * Request Body: None

  * Response Body: Quote

  * `id`

  * `word`

  * `definition`

* Magic 8 ball API:

  * URI: `/magic`

  * Method: `POST`

  * Request Body: Answer

    * (For the sake of the exercise, assume only the question field of the `Answer` object is present in the JSON request body.)

  * Response Body: Answer

* Answer Object instance variables:

  * `id``

  * `question

  * `answer`

#### Additional Requirements

* Your service must contain at least 10 quotes. Quotes must be served up at random.
