# 2.5 Activities

## We Do: Heroku PaaS

In this activity, you will be deploying a Spring Boot Maven microservice project out to the Heroku cloud platform to demonstrate how you can deploy your API projects out to a PaaS cloud platform. The Heroku platform provides a rich and robust environment capable of supporting many kinds of API projects.

Follow along with the instructor throughout the exercise.

**Instructions:**

Review the many available options on the [Heroku dashboard page](https://www.heroku.com/platform/).

Perform a high-level review of the dashboard page by following the numerous links available. Gain a high-level understanding of the many options that Heroku has to offer as described in the following sections:

- Heroku Runtime

- Heroku developer experience

- Data services and ecosystem

- Heroku operational experience

- Security and compliance

## Student Do: Heroku Account Creation and CLI Install

The purpose of this activity is to create a Heroku account and install the CLI tools so that you can deploy
applications to the Heroku PaaS.

You will need:

- Internet connection

- Browser

- Terminal/command prompt

### Instructions

1. Create a user account on the [Heroku homepage](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

    - You will be asked to provide a credit card, but your card will not be charged as long as you use only the free services provided by Heroku.

      - You will only be asked to incorporate free services into your projects.

2. Once your account has been set up, click the New button in the upper-right corner of the page, and follow the prompts to create a new Heroku app.

    - Name the new app bootcamp-practice-app.

    - Click the Create App button.

        - Download the Heroku CLI if you have not already done so.

            - Click the Download Heroku CLI link in the middle of the page to download the appropriate CLI for your computer.

            ![An image of the Heroku download page highlighting a hyperlink that reads Download and install the Heroku CLI](assets/install-cli.png)

            - Log out from the Heroku dashboard user interface.

    - Open a terminal window, and from the command line enter `heroku login`.

        - You will be prompted to open a browser and log in from the browser.

        - Once successfully logged in, you will see a prompt informing you that you are now logged in to Heroku again.

    - Logging in from the command line confirms that the CLI is now operational.

    - Now, delete  bootcamp-practice-app from Heroku.

        - Click bootcamp-practice-app to open that project in Heroku.

        - Click the Settings menu.

        - Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Delete App button.

    ![Image showing Heroku page with Delete App button depressed with warning that deletion is irreversible](assets/delete-app.png)

    - Now you have a free Heroku cloud platform that is ready for API deployments, which you will perform in the upcoming lessons.

After this tutorial you will have:

- A new Heroku account

- The ability to run command-line prompts for Heroku with the Heroku CLI

You are now ready for the deployments to Heroku that you will step-through in the upcoming lessons.

## We Do: Hello Heroku Deployment

The purpose of this tutorial is to step through the deployment of a simple web service on the Heroku cloud platform.

Follow along with the instructor throughout the exercise.

### Building the System

You'll build the system in the following steps:

1. Create the Hello Heroku web service locally.

2. Create the controller.

3. Run Hello Heroku locally.

4. Push Hello Heroku to Heroku.

5. View the service in the Heroku apps manager.

6. Shut down the service.

### Create the Project

The first step is to create the application. You'll use the Spring Initializr to create your project. Go to start.spring.io, and enter the following information:

- Group = com.example

- Artifact = hello-heroku

- Dependencies = Spring Web Starter

- Select Java 8 instead of the default Java 11

Download the project, copy it into your working directory, and open the project in IntelliJ.

### Create the Controller

Now you will create a controller that contains a simple "hello" endpoint. Create a new Java class called `com.trilogyed.helloheroku.controller.HelloController`, and add the following code:

```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @RequestMapping(value = "/hello", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Heroku!!!";
    }
}
```

### Run Hello Heroku Locally

Next, run Hello Heroku with IntelliJ. Open a browser and visit <http://localhost:8080/hello> to make sure your
web service is working properly. You should see `Hello, Heroku!!!` in your browser.

### Sync the Project to Your GitHub Repository

For general instructions, students can use this [guide to creating a repository locally and syncing it to GitHub](assets/initialize-a-repository-and-sync-it-with-github.md).

1. On the GitHub UI, create a repository and name it hello-heroku.

   - Do not create any new files in the repository&mdash;no ReadMe or any files&mdash;just an empty repository in GitHub named the same as the project in your local environment.

2. From the terminal, navigate to the project folder in your workspace.

3. Run the command `git init .`. This will initialize the folder as a git folder on your local machine.

   - Make sure to include the (`.`) at the end of this command.

4. Run the command `git status`. This should show some uncommitted files.

5. Run the command `git add .` to stage the files.

6. Run the command `git commit -m "First Commit"` to commit the files.

7. Run the command `git branch -M main`. This will change the branch from master to main. Main has replaced master in GitHub now.

8. Run the command `git remote add origin [repositoryUrl]` to establish the connection to the repository.

     - `[repositoryUrl]` represents the URL link to the repository, for example, `https://github.com/rwidtmann/hello-heroku.git`.

9. Run the command `git push -u origin main` to push the code and set up tracking on the main branch.

10. Run the command `git status` to confirm that the folder is up-to-date and in sync with the main branch.

### Connect Heroku to the Java API GitHub Repository and Deploy the API

For general instructions, students can use this [guide to deploying a Java application to Heroku](assets/deploy-java-application-to-heroku.md).

1. In a browser, navigate to the [Heroku dashboard page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

2. Create a new app on Heroku named hello-heroku.

   - In the upper-right corner, click the New button and select Create New App.

   - Name the app hello-heroku, and click the Create App button.

     - If the name hello-heroku is not available in Heroku, then choose any alternate name that is similar. For this example on Heroku, you might name the app hello-heroku-app-1.

   - When ready, click the Create New App button to create the application on Heroku.

3. Switch to the terminal, navigate to the `hello-heroku` root folder, and run the following command:

   - Run the command `heroku login`, then follow the prompts to open a browser window, and log in from that browser window.

     This will ensure you are logged in through the Heroku command-line interface (CLI).

4. Run the command `heroku git:remote -a [appName]`.

   - [appName] is what you named the app on Heroku.

   - You should see a confirmation that `git remote heroku` is now set.

5. Run the command `git push heroku main` to push the code and the app out to the Heroku cloud platform.

   - You should see a long tailing log that represents the deployment to Heroku with a final deployment confirmation.

6. Following deployment, return to the [Heroku dashboard page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

   - Click the hello-heroku app.

   - In the upper-right corner, click the More button and select View Logs.

     - You should see logging that confirms that the app was deployed, initialized, and started.

7. Click the Open App button in the upper-right-hand corner. A browser window will open. This app does not
   have a front end, so the app will not display.

     - Copy the URL for the app from the browser window.

     - Paste that URL into another browser window and add /hello to the end of the URL and submit that request. The response should be `Hello, Heroku!!!`, confirming that the app has been deployed to the Heroku cloud platform and is now receiving requests and responding accordingly.

Congratulations! You have just deployed your application to the Heroku cloud platform.

### Important: Shutting Down and Starting the Service

As discussed when you opened your Heroku account, you will be creating only free apps on Heroku. However, it is good practice to always shut down the Heroku service whenever you are not planning on running the service to ensure that you will not incur any usage charges. Here are the steps you can use on the Heroku dashboard to start and stop your services:

- From the Dashboard click the Personal menu.

- Click the app name to open its dashboard.

- In the middle of the Overview page, click the Configure Dynos link.

- You should see the one dyno that is deployed. Click the Edit Icon button for that dyno.

- On this page you should now see the dyno on/off slider button. This is the on/off switch for the service.

  - After changing the on/off setting, be sure to click the Confirm button to save the change.

- Turning this slider to the off position when the service is not needed will ensure that you will not incur any service changes.

## We Do: RSVP Service Deployment

- **Starter Folder:** [02-we-rsvp-service-deploy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15gjAyurx6efhn9Ulx4BMVSmlvuAaG6ad/view?usp=sharing)

The purpose of this tutorial is to work through the deployment of a MySQL-backed web service on the Heroku cloud platform.

Follow along with the instructor throughout the exercise.

### Set Up and Run the Project Locally

1. Open the folder containing the starter code.

2. Create the database for the project on a local instance of MySQL. (The create script is included in the starter code at `src/main/java/resources/schema.sql`.)

   - Database schema:

      ```
      create schema if not exists rsvp;
      use rsvp;
               
      create table if not exists rsvp (
         rsvp_id int not null auto_increment primary key,
         guest_name varchar(50) not null,
         total_attending int not null
      );
      ```

3. Open the RSVP project in IntelliJ, and run the project to confirm all is working properly.

   - You will also need to configure the datasource for the project to connect with the database locally.

4. Make sure you have the RSVP service running correctly in your local environment before moving on.

### Sync the Project to a GitHub Repository

Refer to this [supplemental guide on initializing a repository and syncing it with GitHub](assets/initialize-a-repository-and-sync-it-with-github.md).

1. From the terminal, navigate to the project folder in your workspace.

2. Run the command `git init .`. This will initialize the folder as a git folder in your local.

   - Make sure to include the (`.`) at the end of this command.

3. Run the command `git status`. This should show some uncommitted files.

4. Run the command `git add .` to stage the files.

5. Run the command `git commit -m "First Commit"` to commit the files.

6. Run the command `git branch -M main`. This will change the branch from master to main. Main has replaced master in GitHub now. Leave the terminal open because you'll need it again in a couple of steps.

7. On the GitHub UI, create a repository and name it `rsvp-service`.

   - Do not create any new files in the repository&mdash;no ReadMe or any files&mdash;just an empty repository in GitHub named the same as the project in your local environment.

8. Run the command `git remote add origin [gitHubRepositoryUrl]` to establish the connection to the repository.

     - `[gitHubRepositoryUrl]` is the URL to your repository (for example, `https://github.com/rwidtmann/rsvp-service.git`).

9. Run the command `git push -u origin main` to push the code and set up tracking on the main branch.

10. Run the command `git status` to confirm that the folder is up-to-date and in sync with the main branch.

### Create the Project on the Heroku Cloud Platform

Refer to this [supplemental guide to adding a MySQL database to Heroku](assets/add-mysql-database-to-heroku-app.md).

1. In a browser, navigate to the [Heroku dashboard page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

2. Create a new app on Heroku named rsvp-service-1.

   - In the upper-right corner, click the New button and select Create New App.

   - Name the app rsvp-service-1, and click the Create App button.

     - If the name rsvp-service-1 is not available in Heroku, then choose any alternate name that is similar.

### Add a Free MySQL Database Instance to the Project on Heroku

1. From the Heroku dashboard click the Resources menu.

2. Under Add-ons, type "clearDb" in the field. You will see an option to select the free version of ClearDB MySQL.

   - Click that option, and follow the prompts to add that resource to your rsvp-service-1 instance on Heroku.

> **Note:** Before you can add resources, you will be required to provide a credit card number. As long as you utilize only free add-on resources and do not use more than 999 hours of service processing, you will not be charged. You will not be asked to use any paid resources for any lesson activities.

### Configure MySQL on Heroku

1. On the Heroku dashboard, click the Settings menu at the top of the page.

2. In the middle of the page, find the Config Vars section and click the Reveal Config Vars button.

3. In the middle of the page on the next screen, find the Config Vars section. Take note that there is one config var named `CLEAR_DB_DATABASE_URL`.  

     - Add a new config var named `DB_URL` by typing that name in the Key field.

     - Copy the value in the `CLEAR_DB_DATABASE_URL` variable, and paste that into the value field for the new `DB_URL` that you are creating.

     - Be sure to click the Add button to complete and save the new config var.

### Connect MySQL Workbench to the Heroku MySQL Database, and Run the RSVP Schema

Just like you do in your local environment with your local instance of MySQL, you need to create the database schema and the tables that will be used by your Java API. You will need to do the same in the MySQL database on Heroku to be able to connect your Java API on Heroku with the MySQL support database. To do so, you will connect MySQL Workbench to your MySQL Heroku database in the following steps.

1. Open MySQL Workbench.

2. On the MySQL Workbench dashboard page, locate MySQL Connections, and click the + (plus) symbol to add a new connection.

   - The Set Up New Connection dialog box will open.

3. You will need to provide the required values in the Set Up New Connection dialog box. You will obtain those values from the `DB_URL` config var that you created in the previous section. Follow these steps:

     - Go back to the Heroku Dashboard and again locate the config vars by selecting Settings and then clicking the Reveal Config Vars button to display the `DB_URL` variable.

     - Copy the value of the `DB_URL` variable. That value should look similar to this:

       `mysql://b9bece03b87326:007ff0f7@us-cdbr-east-02.cleardb.com/heroku_e5ea0661158612d?reconnect=true`.

     - You will need to dissect this environment variable to find the values needed to populate the fields in the Set Up New Connection dialog box. Follow this breakdown to obtain the values needed for `Hostname`, `Username`, `Password`, and `default schema`.

     - Obtain the values and populate the Set Up New Connection dialog box with the `Hostname`, `Username`, `Password`, and `default schema` values.

     - Name the Connection by adding a name in the Connection Name field.

     - Click the Test Connection button to verify the connection.

       - You may receive a warning about features on MySQL Workbench that might be unavailable. Click Continue to move forward with the connection test.

     - Once the values are populated and the connection is verified, click the OK button to create the connection.

     - After the connection is created, you will see that new connection as an option on the MySQL Workbench dashboard.

### Create the Schema and Table on Heroku

1. Now that you have MySQL Workbench connected to the Heroku MySQL database, click that connection on the MySQL Workbench dashboard to open the connection.

- On the Schemas menu on the left side of the MySQL Workbench screen, notice that the schema for our new connection is the `default_schema` value that you entered in the New Connection dialog box. This is because, unlike your local MySQL database where you create multiple schemas in our local database instance, you will only have one schema per database instance on Heroku.

  - Now you will want to create the RSVP table on your Heroku database.

    - You will not have to create the schema (because it is already established in our connection), so you will simply want to run the following SQL script to create the table on the Heroku database:

         ```
           use heroku_e5ea0661158612d;
                  
           create table if not exists rsvp (
               rsvp_id int not null auto_increment primary key,
               guest_name varchar(50) not null,
               total_attending int not null
           );
         ```

  - After running the SQL script, you should be able to see that the table is created and you are now able to run SQL queries against the database.

### Connect Heroku to the Java API GitHub Repository and Deploy the API from the Command Line

1. Switch to the terminal, and navigate to the `rsvp-service` root folder.

2. Run the command `heroku git:remote -a [appName]`, where `[appName]` is what you named the app on Heroku (in this example, `rsvp-service-1`).

    - You should receive a confirmation that `git remote heroku` is now set.

3. Run the command `git push heroku main` to push the code and the app out to the Heroku cloud platform.

   - You should see a long tailing log that represents the deployment to Heroku with a final deployment confirmation.

4. Following deployment, return to the [Heroku dashboard page](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

   - Click the rsvp-service-1 app.

   - In the upper-right corner, click the More button and select View Logs.

     - You should find logging that confirms that the app was deployed, initialized, and started.

5. Click the Open App button. A browser window will open. This app does not have a front end, so the app will not display.

     - Copy the URL for the app from the browser window.

6. Open Postman, and create a `POST` transaction to create a new RSVP.

   - Paste the Heroku service URL that you copied in step 5, and add the `/rsvps` URI so that the request will look like this: `https://rsvp-service-1.herokuapp.com/rsvps`.

   - Run the `POST` transaction to create a new RSVP and confirm a successful response.

7. Now go back to MySQL Workbench, and run a `SELECT` query to confirm that the new RSVP is not saved to the Heroku database.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the RSVP service to Heroku.

### Exercise the API

Now you can exercise the RSVP service. The RSVP service has the following API:

```
Create RSVP
===========
URL: `/rsvps`
HTTP Method: `POST`
RequestBody: RSVP data
ResponseBody: RSVP data and id

Get RSVP
========
URL: `/rsvps/{id}`
HTTP Method: `GET`
RequestBody: None
ResponseBody: RSVP data

Get All RSVPs
=============
=============
URL: `/rsvps`
HTTP Method: `GET`
RequestBody: None
ResponseBody: Array of RSVP data

Update RSVP
===========
URL: `/rsvps/{id}`
HTTP Method: `PUT`
RequestBody: RSVP data
ResponseBody: None

Delete RSVP
===========
URL: `/rsvps/{id}`
HTTP Method: `DELETE`
RequestBody: None
ResponseBody: None
```

### Stop Services

Finally, it is always a good idea to stop any services that you are not using to ensure that no service charges will be incurred.

Follow the instructions in step 6 of the Hello Heroku We Do Tutorial to make sure everything is shut down properly.

## Student Do: Recipe Service Build and Deploy

- **Starter & Solved Folders**: [03-stu-recipe-service-build-deploy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CVQjJvC53gmmEK6qSZ9qK68wv908Qx_A/view?usp=sharing)

In this assignment, you will complete the development of the Recipe service provided in the starter code and deploy it to Heroku. The Recipe service allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete recipes. Recipes include a title, description, preparation time, cooking time, and number of servings as well as preparations steps, ingredients, and ratings.

It is your job to complete the Recipe service API, build a React front end for the service, and then deploy the application to the cloud. The Recipe service API will be deployed to Heroku, and the React front end will be deployed to Netlify.

### Setup

- A partially completed Recipe service is included in the starter code for this assignment.

- You must complete the code in this project for this assignment.

- This includes code that implements the data model and JPA persistence code (similar to the code you saw in the prework project).

- You must update the `application.properties` file with the proper credentials for your local MySQL server.

- No further changes are necessary to the model and persistence code.

- The Recipe service API is documented in the `recipe-service-api-documentation.md` file in the `recipe-java-back-end` directory in the starter folder.

### Requirements

#### Server-Side Spring Boot Service

- Complete the Recipe service so that it fully implements the REST API described in the `recipe-service-api-documentation.md` file.
  
  - All of your work will be done in the controllers.
  
  - You must complete the following controllers:
  
    - `PrepStepController`
  
    - `RatingController`
  
    - `RecipeController`
  
  - The `IngredientController` has been fully implemented. Use this as a guide for the remaining controllers. Follow the pattern shown in this code for using the PrepStep, Rating, and Recipe repositories in their respective controllers.

  - After you have implemented the API, you can hit the `/load-data` endpoint to load a recipe into the database. This will help you exercise your API with Postman.

- Deploy your completed Recipe service to Heroku following the steps you used for the RSVP service in the lesson.

  - NOTE: You will NOT have to create the database table with a SQL script as you did with the RSVP service. This is because the Recipe service uses JPA for the persistence layer, and you have configured it to automatically create the database on startup. You will learn about JPA in the next module.

#### Client-Side React App

- Set up and organize components/pages as you see fit.

- The presentation for your user interface does not need to be perfect.  Focus primarily on implementing the functionality as described.

- You will need to display the complete list of Recipes. Consider this the homepage. Each recipe should include:

  - `title`

  - `servings`

  - `prepTime`

  - `cookTime`

  - `category`

- Each Recipe should link to a page to edit and view the ingredients for that particular recipe.

- All of the information on this page should also be editable. This means that you will need forms to add an `ingredient` **in addition to** being able to edit each individual `ingredient`.

- On the homepage, provide a button to add a new recipe. This form would just have the initial details for the recipe. Then, you would click on this recipe to edit and add individual `ingredients`.

- Deploy your React front end to Netlify following the steps described in the lesson.

- If time permits, add functionality to support `prepSteps` and `ratings` as previously described for `ingredients`.
