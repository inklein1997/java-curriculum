## We Do: Full-Stack Record React Back End

**Starter Folder:** [01-we-record-store-back-end](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pbvzk22hq80f_GwcDO9OYnw8epu-7yjX/view?usp=sharing)

In this exercise, you will examine the provided back end API, which you will use as part of the full-stack Record Store application. For this exercise, no coding is required.

### Examine API Definition

* The Record Store API definition can be found in the file `record-store-service-api-documentation.md` in the starter folder.

Open the file and examine its contents. For the front end you will develop, you will leverage the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` functionality from the Record Store back-end application.

### Examine the Files

The backend Records API project can be found in the starter folder.

1. Open the project in IntelliJ.

2. Open the file `Record.java`.  This file contains the structure of the `Record` object.

    ```java
    package com.company.recordstore.models;

    import javax.validation.constraints.NotEmpty;
    import javax.validation.constraints.Size;
    import java.util.Objects;

    public class Record {

        @NotEmpty(message = "You must supply a value for artist")
        private String artist;
        @NotEmpty(message = "You must supply a value for album")
        private String album;
        @NotEmpty(message = "You must supply a value for year")
        @Size(min = 4, max = 4, message = "Year must be exactly 4 digits")
        private String year;
        private int id;

        public Record() { }

        public Record(String artist, String album, String year, int id) {
            this.artist = artist;
            this.album = album;
            this.year = year;
            this.id = id;
        }

        // << SNIP >>
    ```

    As you can see, each `Record` contains the fields `artist`, `album`, and `year`.

3. Open the file `RecordStoreController.java`. This file contains the functionality for the Record Store API.

    ```java
    @RestController
    public class RecordStoreController {

        private static int idCounter = 1;

        private static List<Record> recordList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(
                new Record("The Beach Boys", "Pet Sounds", "1966", idCounter++),
                new Record("Billy Joel", "The Stranger", "1977", idCounter++),
                new Record("The Beatles", "Revolver", "1966", idCounter++),
                new Record("Kanye West", "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy", "2010", idCounter++),
                new Record("Sturgill Simpson", "Metamodern Sounds in Country Music", "2014", idCounter++)
        ));

        @RequestMapping(value = "/records", method = RequestMethod.POST)
        @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.CREATED)
        public Record createRecord(@RequestBody @Valid Record record) {

            record.setId(idCounter++);
            recordList.add(record);

            return record;
        }

        @RequestMapping(value = "/records", method = RequestMethod.GET)
        @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.OK)
        public List<Record> getAllRecords(@RequestParam(required = false) String artist, @RequestParam(required = false) String year) {
            List<Record> returnList = recordList;

            if (artist != null) {
                returnList = recordList.stream()
                        .filter(r -> r.getArtist().contains(artist))
                        .collect(Collectors.toList());
            }

            if (year != null) {
                returnList = returnList.stream()
                        .filter( r -> r.getYear().equals(year))
                        .collect(Collectors.toList());
            }

            return returnList;
        }

        @RequestMapping(value = "/records/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
        @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.OK)
        public Record getRecordById(@PathVariable int id) {
            Record foundRecord = null;

            for(Record record : recordList) {
                if(record.getId() == id) {
                    foundRecord = record;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (foundRecord == null) {
                throw new NotFoundException("Record not found in collection");
            }

            return foundRecord;
        }

        @RequestMapping(value = "/records/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
        @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT)
        public void updateRecordById(@PathVariable int id, @RequestBody @Valid Record record) {

            if( record.getId() == 0 ) {
                record.setId(id);
            }

            if( record.getId() != id) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Id in parameter must match the ID in the request body");
            }

            int index = -1;

            for(int i = 0; i < recordList.size(); i++) {
                if(recordList.get(i).getId() == id) {
                    index = i;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (index >= 0) {
                recordList.set(index, record);
            }
        }

        @RequestMapping(value = "/records/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
        @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT)
        public void deleteRecordById(@PathVariable int id) {
            int index = -1;

            for(int i = 0; i < recordList.size(); i++) {
                if(recordList.get(i).getId() == id) {
                    index = i;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (index >= 0) {
                recordList.remove(index);
            }
            else throw new NotFoundException("Record not found.");
        }
    }
    ```

### Deploy the Application

From IntelliJ, build and run the application.

You should see the familiar Spring Boot message displayed in the IntelliJ output window, and the application should launch, making use of port 8080.

As you move forward, this service should remain running throughout while you are building the front-end component.

### Browser/Postman Testing

As a quick review of API testing, you will now quickly test the back-end functionality.

This will also better familiarize you with the API as you progress to building the front end.

1. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/records. The browser should display the five initial records in `JSON` format:

    ```json
    [{"artist":"The Beach Boys","album":"Pet Sounds","year":"1966","id":1},{"artist":"Billy Joel","album":"The Stranger","year":"1977","id":2},{"artist":"The Beatles","album":"Revolver","year":"1966","id":3},{"artist":"Kanye West","album":"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy","year":"2010","id":4},{"artist":"Sturgill Simpson","album":"Metamodern Sounds in Country Music","year":"2014","id":5}]
    ```

2. Open the Postman application, which you will use to test the Record API functionality.

3. Execute a `GET` request against the URL http://localhost:8080/records. Again, this should return each of the five test records.

4. Execute a `GET` request against the URL http://localhost:8080/records/1. This should return the single "Beach Boys, Pet Sounds" record.

5. Execute a `PUT` request against the URL http://localhost:8080/records/1 to update the first record. Specify the following `JSON` in the request body to do so:

    ```json
    {
        "artist": "The Beach Boys",
        "album": "Surf's Up",
        "year": "1971"
    }
    ```

6. To test that your update was successful, once again execute a `GET` request against the URL http://localhost:8080/records/1.

7. Execute a `POST` request against the URL http://localhost:8080/records to create a new record. Specify the following `JSON` in the request body to do so:

    ```json
    {
        "artist": "Throwing Muses",
        "album": "The Real Ramona",
        "year": "1991"
    }
    ```

8. To test that your new record was successfully created, execute a `GET` request against the URL http://localhost:8080/records.

9. Execute a `DELETE` request against the URL http://localhost:8080/records/1 to delete the first record.

10. To test that your new record was successfully deleted, execute a `GET` request against the URL http://localhost:8080/records.

## We Do: Full-Stack Record React Front End

* **Starter & Solved Folders:** [02-we-record-store-front-end](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ku_IvIB9JuCe--VnQsKIWL_Va6_IUpAt/view?usp=sharing)

At this point, you have built and executed the Record Store back-end API and understand how to use it. Again, the back-end application should remain running throughout the ensuing front-end development.

Move forward now by building upon the back-end API with a React front end.

### Starter Application

The application in the starter folder was generated using the command `npx create-react-app`, of which you should already be familiar.

Open a command prompt and navigate to the starter folder.

Run the commands `npm install` and `npm start` to launch the unmodified starter version of the application. In the browser that launches, displayed should be an empty table of Records.  You will be adding functionality to the application throughout the exercise.

The application can be left running throughout the rest of the exercise. As you make changes, the browser should automatically load and make use of them.

### Examine the Starter Code

Examine a few files to get familiar with the basic architecture.

Open the file `App.js` from the `src` directory of the starter project.

```JS
import Records from './Records.js';

function App() {
  return (
    <main className="container">
      <Records />
    </main>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This is obviously a simple page, displaying only the contents from `Records.js`.

Now open the file `Records.js` from the `src` directory of the starter project.

```JS
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import './Records.css';
import RecordCard from './RecordCard.js';
import RecordForm from './RecordForm.js';

function Records() {

    const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
    const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(false);
    const [scopedRecord, setScopedRecord] = useState({});
    const [error, setError] = useState();

    function addClick() {
    }

    function notify({ action, record, error }) {
        if (error) {
            setError(error);
            setShowForm(false);
            return;
        }
    }

    if (showForm) {
        return <RecordForm record={scopedRecord} notify={notify} />
    }

    return (
        <>
            {error && <div className="alert alert-danger">{error}</div>}
            <div>
                <h1 id='recordTitle'>Records</h1>
                <button className="btn btn-primary" type="button" onClick={addClick}>Add a Recipe</button>
                <table id='records'>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Artist</th>
                        <th>Album</th>
                        <th>Year</th>
                        <th>Actions</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tbody>
                        {records.map(r => <RecordCard key={r.recordId} record={r} notify={notify} />)}
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
        </>
    )
}

export default Records;
```

The code here results in the page currently displayed in the browser.  You will be completing the functionality of this page throughout the exercise.

* The basic table structure for the Records is handled by `Records.js`, which is essentially the "home page" for the application.
* The individual table rows are displayed via `RecordCard.js`
* Add and Edit functionality is handled by `RecordForm.js`

### Displaying Records Data

Open the file `RecordCard.js` from the `src` folder of the starter project.

```JS
function RecordCard({ record, notify }) {

    function handleDelete() {
    }

    return (
        <tr key={record.recordId}>
            <td>{record.artist}</td>
            <td>{record.album}</td>
            <td>{record.year}</td>
            <td>
                <button id="deleteButton" className="btn btn-danger mr-3" type="button" onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</button>
                <button id="editButton" className="btn btn-secondary" type="button" onClick={() => notify({ action: "edit-form", record: record })}>Edit</button>
            </td>
        </tr>
    );
}

export default RecordCard;
```

Key points:

* Recall from the API that a Record has the following three fields: `artist`, `album`, and `year`.

* The `RecordCard` will be used by `Records.js` to display the individual Records.

Now modify the contents of `Records.js` by adding the `useEffect()` method as follows:

```JS
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import './Records.css';
import RecordCard from './RecordCard.js';

function Records() {

    const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
    const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(false);
    const [scopedRecord, setScopedRecord] = useState({});
    const [error, setError] = useState();

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch("http://localhost:8080/records")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(result => setRecords(result))
        .catch(console.log);
    }, []);

<< SNIP >>
```

Displayed in the table at this point should be the list of default Records.

`Records.js` uses the React Hooks `useState` and `useEffect`.

* React Hooks provide a mechanism by which you can tie ("hook") into the React page lifecycle.

* With `useState`, you can maintain page state (variables) that persist when the page refreshes.

* With `useEffect`, you can fetch data into the page after it has been rendered.

With the following, you include the array records in the page state:

```JS
const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
```

You then fetch the records from the API via `useEffect()`.

### Deleting a Record

Each row in the table contains "Delete" and "Edit" buttons.  Neither is functional at this point.

To delete a record, you must first add a handler for the "Delete" button.

Implement the `handleDelete()` method in `RecordCard.js` as follows:

```JS
function RecordCard({ record, notify }) {

    function handleDelete() {
        fetch(`http://localhost:8080/records/${record.id}`, { method: "DELETE" })
            .then(() => notify({ action: "delete", record: record }))
            .catch(error => notify({ action: "delete", error: error }));
    }

    return (
        <tr key={record.recordId}>
            <td>{record.artist}</td>
            <td>{record.album}</td>
            <td>{record.year}</td>
            <td>
                <button id="deleteButton" className="btn btn-danger mr-3" type="button" onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</button>
                <button id="editButton" className="btn btn-secondary" type="button" onClick={() => notify({ action: "edit-form", record: record })}>Edit</button>
            </td>
        </tr>
    );
}

export default RecordCard;
```

Key points:

* You have added a `handleDelete()` method in response to the Delete button being pressed.

* An important detail is that you have given the Delete button the type `button`. Without the type specified, some browsers will default to the button type `submit`, meaning that a button press will be treated in the same way as a Save button. This can cause unexpected behavior that is difficult to diagnose.

* The `RecordCard` function accepts as an argument a `notify` callback method. This allows the `RecordCard` to communicate status back to the parent `Records` function.

* At this point, pressing the Delete button will delete the record but will not automatically update the list of records on the page. To demonstrate this, press one of Delete buttons and refresh the page.

* This happens because you need to update the `notify()` method in `Records.js`.

To automatically refresh the page after the deletion, you must update the `notify()` method of `Records.js` as follows:

```JS
    function notify({ action, record, error }) {
        if (error) {
            setError(error);
            setShowForm(false);
            return;
        }
        switch (action) {
            case "delete":
                setRecords(records.filter(e => e.id !== record.id));
                break;
        }
    }
```

Key points:

* In `Records.js` you pass the notify function via `notify={notify}`.

```JS
    <tbody>
        {records.map(r => <RecordCard key={r.recordId} record={r} notify={notify} />)}
    </tbody>
```

* The function `notify({ action, record, error })` in `Records.js` then serves as the callback.

* In response to a deletion and callback in `handleDelete()` by a `RecordCard`, `notify()` updates the state of the records accordingly.

### Add/Edit Form

Open the file `RecordForm.js` from the `src` folder of the starter project.

This file is shared by Add and Edit functionality.

```JS
import { useState } from 'react';

function RecordForm({ record: initialRecord, notify }) {

    const [record, setRecord] = useState(initialRecord);
    const isAdd = initialRecord.id === 0;

    function handleChange(evt) {
        const clone = { ...record };
        clone[evt.target.name] = evt.target.value;
        setRecord(clone);
    }

    function handleSubmit(evt) {
        evt.preventDefault();

        const url = isAdd ? "http://localhost:8080/records" : `http://localhost:8080/records/${record.id}`;
        const method = isAdd ? "POST" : "PUT";
        const expectedStatus = isAdd ? 201 : 204;

        const init = {
            method,
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
                "Accept": "application/json"
            },
            body: JSON.stringify(record)
        };

        fetch(url, init)
            .then(response => {
                if (response.status === expectedStatus) {
                    if (isAdd) {
                        return response.json();
                    } else {
                        return record;
                    }
                }
                return Promise.reject(`Didn't receive expected status: ${expectedStatus}`);
            })
            .then(result => notify({
                action: isAdd ? "add" : "edit",
                record: result
            }))
            .catch(error => notify({ error: error }));

    }

    return (
        <>
            <h1>{record.id > 0 ? "Edit" : "Add"} Record</h1>
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                <div className="mb-3">
                    <label htmlFor="artist">Artist</label>
                    <input type="text" id="artist" name="artist"
                        className="form-control"
                        value={record.artist} onChange={handleChange} />
                </div>
                <div className="mb-3">
                    <label htmlFor="album">Album</label>
                    <input type="text" id="album" name="album"
                        className="form-control"
                        value={record.album} onChange={handleChange} />
                </div>
                <div className="mb-3">
                    <label htmlFor="year">Year</label>
                    <input type="text" id="year" name="year"
                        className="form-control"
                        value={record.year} onChange={handleChange} />
                </div>
                <div className="mb-3">
                    <button className="btn btn-primary mr-3" type="submit">Save</button>
                    <button className="btn btn-secondary" type="button" onClick={() => notify({ action: "cancel" })}>Cancel</button>
                </div>
            </form>
        </>
    );
}

export default RecordForm;
```

Key points:

* Here you use only the `useState` hook, this time to represent the state of the record begin edited or added.

* Once again, you pass in a `notify()` callback to send notifications back to the `Records` class.

* The `RecordForm` uses the initial Record ID to determine whether the action is an "add" or "edit."

* If the initial ID is zero, the action is add; otherwise, the action is edit.

* The URL, HTTP verb, and expected HTTP status are all determined from whether the action is add or edit.

* When the Submit button is pressed, the code invokes a `PUT` or `POST` request to the API to update or add the `Record`.

* Otherwise, the bulk of the code is shared between both actions.

### Edit Functionality

As with Delete functionality, Edit functionality is particular to an individual record. Accordingly, with each `RecordCard` is associated an Edit button:

```JS
    <td>
        <button id="deleteButton" className="btn btn-danger mr-3" type="button" onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</button>
        <button id="editButton" className="btn btn-secondary" type="button" onClick={() => notify({ action: "edit-form", record: record })}>Edit</button>
    </td>
```

In response to the Edit button being pressed, the `notify()` method is called with the action "edit-form".  The form is then launched, and upon the "Save" button being pressed, `notify()` is once again called with the action "edit".

With this in mind, modify the `notify()` method of `Records.js` accordingly to handle the "edit-form" and "edit" cases:

```JS
    function notify({ action, record, error }) {

        if (error) {
            setError(error);
            setShowForm(false);
            return;
        }

        switch (action) {
            case "edit":
                setRecords(records.map(e => {
                    if (e.id === record.id) {
                        return record;
                    }
                    return e;
                }));
                break;
            case "edit-form":
                setScopedRecord(record);
                setShowForm(true);
                return;
            case "delete":
                setRecords(records.filter(e => e.id !== record.id));
                break;
        }
        
        setError("");
        setShowForm(false);
    }
```

By calling `setShowForm(true)`, the `RecordForm` will be displayed, via the code later in `Records.js`:

```JS
    if (showForm) {
        return <RecordForm record={scopedRecord} notify={notify} />
    }
```

### Adding a New Record

`Records.js` contains an Add button, separate from the individual Records.

```JS
    <button className="btn btn-primary" type="button" onClick={addClick}>Add a Recipe</button>
```

The handler for the Add button is the `addClick()` method.

In `Records.js`, add the implementation for `addClick()` as follows:

```JS
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import './Records.css';
import RecordCard from './RecordCard.js';
import RecordForm from './RecordForm.js';

function Records() {

    const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
    const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(false);
    const [scopedRecord, setScopedRecord] = useState({});
    const [error, setError] = useState();

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch("http://localhost:8080/records")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(result => setRecords(result))
        .catch(console.log);
    }, []);

    function addClick() {
        const now = new Date();
        setScopedRecord({ id: 0, artist: "", album: "", year: now.getFullYear() });
        setShowForm(true);
    }

<< SNIP >>
```

With the `addClick()` implementation, once again you call `setShowForm(true)`, this time passing the `RecordForm` a new Record.

The Save button in `RecordsForm.js` sends back the "add" notification to `Records.js` via the `notify()` callback.

Modify the `notify()` method of `Records.js` to handle the "add" case as follows:

```JS
    function notify({ action, record, error }) {

        if (error) {
            setError(error);
            setShowForm(false);
            return;
        }

        switch (action) {
            case "add":
                setRecords([...records, record]);
                break;
            case "edit":
                setRecords(records.map(e => {
                    if (e.id === record.id) {
                        return record;
                    }
                    return e;
                }));
                break;
            case "edit-form":
                setScopedRecord(record);
                setShowForm(true);
                return;
            case "delete":
                setRecords(records.filter(e => e.id !== record.id));
                break;
        }
        
        error = "";
        setShowForm(false);
    }
```

Key points:

* Here you use only the `useState` hook, this time to represent the state of the record begin edited.

* Once again, you pass in a `notify()` callback to send notifications back to the `Records` class.

* When the Submit button is pressed, the code invokes a `PUT` request to the API to add the `Record`.

## We Do: Deploy to Netlify

At this point, the app is running only locally. You will see now how simple it is to get it up on the web.

### Step 1: Add This Application to GitHub

Fortunately, you already have everything you need in the application for a good repository in GitHub, especially a `.gitignore`.

In GitHub, create a new completely empty repository called `record-store-react-front-end`. Leave it `Public`. Do not add a `README`, a `.gitignore`, or a license. Just click the Create Repository button.

![Image displaying the "Create Repository" screen](assets/github-100-create-repository.png)

Follow the "...or create a new repository on the command line" instructions on the next page.

![Image displaying steps to create a new repository on the command line](assets/github-110-connect-repository.png)

You'll want to push everything from your local machine as follows:

```
git add -A
git commit -m 'initial push'
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Create an Account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

It's simplest to just use your GitHub account to do this. You'll need to connect to that (or whichever other repository service).

### Step 3: npm run build

Now ensure that the project can be built locally before deployment.

* From the project directory, run `npm run build`. This is provided to as an `npm` script (inside 'package.json') by CRA&mdash;`create-react-app`.

* You will see a message: Creating an optimized production build...

> **Note:** The front end is hardcoded to talk to the Record Store API on localhost:3000. Because the front end runs locally in the browser (whether you're in development mode or the app is served from Netlify), you will be able to talk to the local API. But if you were to actually deploy a production application, you would deploy the Record Store API to the web and talk to it from the React app by changing the value of `baseUrl` in `src/api/index.js`

### Step 4: New Site from Git

* That's the big green button that says New Site from Git that you want to click on. This will ask you to authorize Netlify to access our repositories on GitHub.

* Next, you'll see a list of your repositories.

* Select the correct one.

* On the next screen, accept the defaults. Netlify knows about CRA and realizes that you are trying to launch a React app. It understands that the live content is in the `build` directory.

* Click the green Deploy Site button, and you are done!

* After a few seconds, the site will be deployed at a random URL.

* You can customize this URL a bit. From the Site Overview tab, you can select Site settings and then Change Site Name.

* You will see many other options here, but for a simple app, that's all you need at this point.

* For other apps, you may need to review the Build and Deploy section and update other settings such as Environment Variables.
